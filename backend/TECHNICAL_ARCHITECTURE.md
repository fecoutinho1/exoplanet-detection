# Technical Architecture and Mission Compatibility
## Exoplanet Detection System - NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025

### Current System Architecture

The exoplanet detection system is built using a modular object-oriented design that separates data processing, model inference, and API functionality. The core architecture consists of three main components: the ExoplanetDetector class for machine learning operations, the ExoplanetAPI class for REST API functionality, and utility functions for system initialization.

The ExoplanetDetector class encapsulates the complete machine learning pipeline, including data validation, preprocessing, and prediction. It loads three essential components during initialization: the trained XGBoost model, the StandardScaler for data normalization, and the feature list that defines the required input parameters.

### Data Processing Pipeline

The current data processing pipeline is specifically designed for Kepler mission data. It expects input data in a dictionary format containing 15 specific features that are characteristic of Kepler Object of Interest (KOI) data. The preprocessing steps include data type validation, missing value imputation using median values, and standardization using the fitted scaler.

The validation system ensures that all required features are present in the input data and that the data types are appropriate for machine learning processing. Missing values are handled by replacing them with the median value for each feature, which was determined during the training phase.

### Model Training and Performance

The system uses an XGBoost classifier trained on 9,564 Kepler observations with 15 features. The model achieves 98.74% accuracy, 98.17% precision, and 99.24% recall on the test dataset. These performance metrics demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach for Kepler data classification.

The training process used GroupShuffleSplit to prevent data leakage, ensuring that all observations from the same star are either in the training or test set. This approach is crucial for astronomical data where multiple observations of the same object could lead to overfitting.

### Mission-Specific Limitations

The current implementation has several limitations when considering multi-mission support. The feature names are hardcoded to Kepler conventions (koi_period, koi_duration, etc.), and the preprocessing steps are optimized for Kepler data characteristics.

Different missions have different observational strategies and data formats. TESS, for example, uses different feature naming conventions and has different precision characteristics due to shorter observation periods. James Webb Space Telescope data would require completely different preprocessing approaches due to its spectroscopic nature.

### Generalization Strategy

To extend the system to multiple missions, a multi-layered architecture would be required. The first layer would be a mission detection module that identifies the source mission based on data characteristics and feature names. This module would route incoming data to the appropriate preprocessing pipeline.

The second layer would consist of mission-specific preprocessing modules that handle the unique characteristics of each mission's data format. These modules would normalize the data to a common format while preserving the mission-specific information that might be relevant for classification.

The third layer would contain mission-specific trained models, each optimized for the particular characteristics of its respective mission data. An ensemble method could combine predictions from multiple models when data from different missions is available for the same candidate.

### Implementation Requirements

The expansion to multiple missions would require significant development effort in several areas. Data collection and preprocessing for each mission would need to be implemented, including handling different file formats, data structures, and quality assessment systems.

The machine learning models would need to be retrained on mission-specific datasets, which would require access to validated exoplanet catalogs for each mission. This includes both confirmed exoplanets and false positives for proper training data balance.

The API interface would need to be enhanced to support mission-specific parameters and return mission-specific metadata along with classification results. This would allow users to understand which mission's data was used for the classification and what confidence levels are associated with each mission's model.

### Data Harmonization Challenges

One of the major challenges in multi-mission support is data harmonization. Different missions use different units, precision levels, and quality assessment criteria. Creating a unified input format while preserving mission-specific information requires careful design.

The quality flag systems vary significantly between missions. Kepler uses specific false positive flags that may not have direct equivalents in other missions. Adapting these systems requires understanding each mission's data validation procedures and creating appropriate mappings.

Observational characteristics also differ between missions. Kepler's long observation periods provide high-precision measurements, while TESS's shorter observation periods offer broader sky coverage but with different precision characteristics. These differences must be accounted for in the preprocessing and modeling stages.

### Performance Considerations

Multi-mission support would increase the computational requirements of the system. Loading multiple models and preprocessing pipelines would require more memory and processing power. The system would need to be optimized for efficient model loading and inference.

Caching strategies would be important for maintaining performance when switching between different mission models. The system should be designed to load models on-demand and cache frequently used models to minimize response times.

The API would need to handle requests for different missions efficiently, potentially requiring load balancing and resource management strategies for production deployment.

### Validation and Testing

Comprehensive validation would be required to ensure that the multi-mission system maintains the high accuracy achieved on individual missions. This includes testing with known exoplanet candidates from each mission and validating the mission detection and routing logic.

Edge cases and error conditions would need to be thoroughly tested, including scenarios where mission detection fails or where data from multiple missions is available for the same candidate. The system should gracefully handle these situations and provide appropriate error messages and fallback mechanisms.

### Future Development Priorities

The immediate priority for multi-mission support would be implementing TESS data compatibility, as TESS is the most similar to Kepler in terms of observational methodology. This would involve creating TESS-specific preprocessing modules and training a TESS-specific model.

The next phase would involve integrating James Webb Space Telescope data, which would require more significant architectural changes due to the different observational approach. This might involve creating a separate classification pathway for spectroscopic data.

Long-term development would focus on creating a truly universal system that can automatically adapt to new missions as they become available. This would require developing more sophisticated mission detection algorithms and creating more flexible preprocessing pipelines.

### Conclusion

The current system provides an excellent foundation for multi-mission exoplanet detection, with its modular architecture and high performance on Kepler data. The expansion to multiple missions is technically feasible but requires significant development effort in data harmonization, mission-specific preprocessing, and model training.

The key to success lies in maintaining the high accuracy achieved on individual missions while creating a flexible architecture that can adapt to different mission characteristics. This approach would provide a powerful tool for the astronomical community while meeting the NASA Space Apps Challenge requirements for multi-mission support.
